## Planet Billiard
The earth is under attack by planet sized aliens. You can defend the earth by ramming earth into them, but take care of the resulting explosions.

If not clear, this is a work in progress.

### What I learned

- My first use case of non-null assertion operator.
- My second Canvas use, but first use with React and Typescript.
